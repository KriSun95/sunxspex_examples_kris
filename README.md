# sunxspex_examples_kris

This repo is just to present some examples of my code when working with Sunxspex.

The Jupyter Notebook, model_testing.ipynb, shows how the code is used.

The photon_models module contains my version of f_vth.

The sunxspex and sunxspex-thermal packages were the main branch and Dan's thermal branch of Sunxspex (before 11/June/2021).
